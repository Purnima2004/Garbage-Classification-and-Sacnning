# Project Description
This collaborative effort involved the development of two machine learning models designed to scan and classify various types of garbage, including plastic, glass, rubber, and more. The project engaged a team of five members.
As efficiently as I could, I concentrated on data augmentation, which is a critical component of improving the model's performance.
Through this project, I gained invaluable practical experience, applying our collective knowledge to real-world problems. 
The collaboration not only enriched my understanding of machine learning but also provided insights into the application of artificial intelligence to address environmental challenges.
